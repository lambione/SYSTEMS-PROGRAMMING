# 💻✨ SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING COURSE – SPRING SEMESTER EDITION 🌸📚
System Programming course @ USI - Universita' della Svizzera Italiana


Welcome to my **Systems Programming** repository! 🧠⚙️  
This repo includes every single exercise 📝 I developed **from scratch** during the **Spring semester** 🌱 at university! It's a raw, honest, and complete representation of my systems-level coding journey. 💪🧑‍💻

## 📁 What's in this Repo?

### 📜 `EXERCISES.pdf`
All the **assignment texts** 📑 given throughout the course are in this file.  
Each section represents a programming challenge that dives deep into systems programming topics! 🧵🧰

### 🧪 `EXERCISES_WITH_TESTS/`
This directory contains:
- 💻 My **exact code submissions** as I wrote them during the course
- 🧪 **Test cases** to validate the implementations
- 🛠️ A **Makefile** in *every* directory for easy build and test automation

> 🟡 This is the **raw code** – untouched, unrefined, and 100% my own development during the semester 💯  
> It's not production-level, but it's genuine and full of learning 🙌

## 🚀 How to Run the Code + Tests

To run any of the exercises with tests:

1. Open your terminal 🖥️

2. Navigate to any exercise directory inside `EXERCISES_WITH_TESTS/<CHOSEN-ONE>`:

3. Run the following command: 
    ```bash
    make
    ```

✅ This will **automatically compile** the code and **run all associated tests** 🎯  
No need to compile manually or set up additional scripts – it’s all handled by the Makefile 🧙‍♂️📦
