The exam starts tomorrow, Tuesday 3 September at 9:30. The text of the exam will be available on iCorsi at that time along with the submission form. This is an on-line written exam. I will be available on Teams to answer questions. You may send me questions using direct messages on Teams.

Below are the general rules and instructions for this exam:

    This is an individual exam. You must solve the exercises on your own. You may consult your notes or course material, as well as on-line documentation such as cppreference.com. However, you must acknowledge in writing, in comments within your code, any and all material or sources you consult during the exam.
    Write and submit source files with the exact names specified in each exercise.
    Your code must compile with the standard-configuration C/C++ compiler.
    You may not use any external function other than those of the standard C/C++ library.
    Your code must comply with the specification exactly.
    Your code must be of good quality.
    Your code must pass the tests! The tests are provided together with the problem descriptions.
    Document any known issue using comments in the code
    Submit each file through the iCorsi system.
    The exam lasts two hours, so the deadline for submission is at 11:30.
